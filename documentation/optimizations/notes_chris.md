# Optimization Notes by Chris

## Elligator 1: 
### string_to_point

Steps done:


- Use refactored bigints
- Precompute various constants
- Strength reductions (Change sign instead of mult with chi)
- Compute the powers of you jointly.
- Reduce number of bigints used for inbetween results
- Reduce the amopunt of copying data
