# Censorship-avoiding high-speed EC (Elligator with Curve1174)
In this repository, we look into a performance optimized implementation of [Elligator](https://elligator.cr.yp.to/) in the context of the Advanced Systems Lab. Elligator is a system that maps random strings to points on elliptic curves. This should thwart censorship as it is difficult to detect that elliptic curve cryptography is used.
