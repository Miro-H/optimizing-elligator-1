# Report
This folder contains a submodule linking to the overleaf report.

The purpose of this is just to have everything at one place. To initialize the submodule, run:
```
git submodule init
```

The final report is [here](./Elligator_1_Optimization.pdf).

## Editing
**WARNING:** Please do not edit any files directly in the submodule on this git. Edit them _only_ on Overleaf.

To edit the report, go to [this Overleaf link](https://www.overleaf.com/). You can log in with your ETH credentials (over SSO), or link an existing account to the ETH one. I've granted your ETH email addresses access to edit the report.
